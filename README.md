# final
Created with CodeSandbox by Mazen Mohsen

Due to very short timeframe (me being busy and the test being sent to me 3-4 days instead of 1 week before deadline) the project has been built very simply and with some help of pre-existing code.

The dataset given to me has been converted to a JSON database file  (Requirment 3). Front-end web application has very basic design elements with HTML, CSS and JS (requirment 1), the front end application allows you to view a home screen with some books, and a visible search bar where you can search by entering title or author name.

CI/CD has been integrated with the help of CircleCi

REST Api has been integrated with the ability to GET, POST  (requirment 2).

The whole application has been uploaded to Github (Requirment 7) and here is the link to view it.

The application has been hosted on AWS (requirment 4) amplify and here is the link
